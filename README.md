# Sheep-Herder
Solo project for university, made using the Leap Motion Controller as the sole form of input from the player
Project used hand gestures and movements from the player, paired with the Leap Motion Controller, to control all aspects of the game.
The game also used perlin noise to randomly generate the field of objects in each playthrough, resulting in different layouts each time.
